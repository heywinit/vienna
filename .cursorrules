Vienna is an offline-first life management web app.

## offline-first
We use zustand as our backend since this is all local. The zustand stores store all the data.

## data model
- All entities (tasks, projects, notes, timers, counters, nutrition, habits) support soft delete and restore.
- All entities support tags for global cross-feature filtering.
- Hydration is tracked as a counter, not a separate store.

## export/import
- All data can be exported as a SQLite database file.
- (Optional) Support for importing from a SQLite backup.

## tag management
- Tags are managed globally via a tag manager for CRUD and cross-feature filtering.

## features
- Task management, timer/stopwatch, counters, nutrition tracking, habits, projects, notes, global tags, soft delete/restore, SQLite export, offline-first.
- Advanced: search, analytics/dashboard, reminders, recurring tasks/habits, custom views, quick add, theming, encryption, versioning/undo, attachments, API/plugins.
